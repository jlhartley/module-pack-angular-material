  "question": "Explain the difference in the ease of bromination between cyclohexene and benzene",
  "keypoints": [
    {
      "answer": "Addition of bromine to benzene is harder than addition of bromine to cyclohexene."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Cyclohexene readily reacts with bromine water."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Large localised electron density of the C=C double bond in alkenes can create dipoles on the bromine molecule."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Benzene requires halogen carrier."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Benzene's delocalised electrons are spread over all 6 carbons in the ring."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Benzene has a lower pi-electron density than alkenes."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Benzene is very stable due to the delocalisation of benzene ring."
    },
    {
      "answer": "Delocalisation makes it harder to produce dipoles on the halogen molecule (hence the need for halogen carrier)."
    },
    {
      "answer": "High electron density of double bond in cyclohexene makes it easier to form dipoles on the halogen molecule."
